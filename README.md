# database-ECGsignals-Arrythmia-CongestiveHeartFailure-CollectedData
This dataset is collected while I was working on my PhD project -AI and IoT in healthcare- This project aims to use late trends in AI and IoT to improve flow patient . Subjects and ethical approval: twelve of nonsmokers consisting of 9 men and 3 women volunteered to participate in our study, six of them suffers from Arrhythmia, one from congestive failure and 5 have a normal heartbeat. All subjects do not suffer any type of allergy or other diseases others than cardiovascular diseases, female subjects were not pregnant, and all subjects aged between 45 and 60 years. 24 hours before recording, we instructed subjects to have enough rest, to refrain from any type of exercises and not to drink any type of stimulants like caffeine. The subjects received a verbal explanation about the experiment and what is used for. Experimental protocol: we instrumented volunteers with a single lead ECG sensor, as shown in Figure below, the main advantage of this circuit is flexibility, it can be easily connected to any type of laptops and can be used anytime and anywhere, it can be used in rural area and cities, as the instrument do not require any type of special connection, no battery required. The circuit consists of one AD8232 sensor connected to Arduino Uno. The records hold 6 minutes and 13 seconds in an airtight chamber.
